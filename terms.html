        <!-- 5. Materials & Technical Limits -->
        <section id="section-5">
          <h2>5. Materials and Technical Limits</h2>
          <p>
            5.1 We currently offer high quality PLA in several variants
            (Matte, Pro, Silk, Wood) and PETG, with other materials being added
            over time where possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.2 The maximum size for a single 3D printed object is approximately
            <strong>256 mm by 256 mm by 256 mm</strong>. Larger designs can be
            printed in separate pieces and assembled afterward.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.3 We use modern consumer grade printers for high resolution and
            fast prints. However, minor print artefacts and dimensional
            variations are normal for FDM printing.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- 6. Pricing, Quotations & Vouchers -->
        <section id="section-6">
          <h2>6. Pricing, Quotations and Vouchers</h2>
          <p>
            6.1 Pricing is usually based on a combination of material used,
            print time, complexity, model repair, post processing, and any
            special filament that must be ordered specifically for your job.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2 Base pricing is normally calculated per gram of filament and may
            vary by material type. The latest indicative rates are shown on our
            website and may change from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.3 All quotations are estimates. Final material weight and time can
            differ slightly after printing. We reserve the right to adjust the
            final price within a reasonable range, for example plus or minus ten
            percent, based on actual usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.4 For bulk orders, such as club or event souvenirs, we may offer
            discounted rates depending on quantity, complexity, and deadline.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.5 Promotional vouchers or welcome offers are subject to their own
            conditions, such as validity period, minimum spend, and usage limits.
            They cannot be exchanged for cash.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- 7. Payment Terms -->
        <section id="section-7">
          <h2>7. Payment Terms</h2>
          <p>7.1 We currently accept payments such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cash.</li>
            <li>Touch n Go eWallet.</li>
            <li>DuitNow QR.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            7.2 As a general rule, payment is required before we start printing.
            For larger or complex jobs we may accept deposits, but this is at
            our discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            7.3 Once printing has started, payments are normally non refundable
            except in limited situations described under print quality and
            reprints.

        <!-- 8. Turnaround Time -->
        <section id="section-8">
          <h2>8. Turnaround Time</h2>
          <p>
            8.1 Many prints can be completed on the same day, while more complex
            designs can take several days depending on size, queue, and required
            finishing.
          </p>
          <p>
            8.2 Any time estimate provided is an approximation only. Factors
            such as power interruptions, machine maintenance, exam periods, or
            campus events may cause delays. We will try to inform you if a
            noticeable delay is expected.

        <!-- 9. Customer Responsibilities -->
        <section id="section-9">
          <h2>9. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            9.1 You are responsible for the correctness and suitability of your
            3D models. This includes dimensions, tolerances, clearance, fit,
            and overall design strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            9.2 You are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to use,
            print, or reproduce the design and that it does not infringe any
            copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights.
          </p>
          <p>9.3 You agree not to request or submit designs for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Real weapons or weapon components.</li>
            <li>Items intended to cause harm or be used as dangerous devices.</li>
            <li>Illegal items under Malaysian law.</li>
            <li>Counterfeit goods or items that infringe third party rights.</li>
            <li>Content that is hateful, abusive, or otherwise inappropriate.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            9.4 We reserve the right to refuse any order where we are not
            comfortable with the design, intended use, or legal risk.

        <!-- 10. Intellectual Property -->
        <section id="section-10">
          <h2>10. Intellectual Property and Portfolio Use</h2>
          <p>
            10.1 All 3D models, CAD files, and designs that you provide remain
            your property. We do not claim ownership over your designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.2 We will only use your files for feasibility analysis, quoting,
            printing, and internal quality or record keeping.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.3 We may take photos or short videos of printed parts and use
            them on our website or social media as part of our portfolio without
            sharing your actual design files.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.4 If your project is sensitive, for example a final year project
            or a competition prototype with confidentiality concerns, you may
            request in writing that we do not share images of your prints
            publicly.

        <!-- 11. Print Quality & Reprints -->
        <section id="section-11">
          <h2>11. Print Quality, Reprints and Cancellations</h2>
          <p>
            11.1 You understand that FDM printed parts will have visible layer
            lines and may show minor artefacts such as stringing or small
            surface imperfections. Slight color variation between batches is
            also normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            11.2 Dimensional accuracy is influenced by geometry and material.
            We aim for reasonable tolerances typical for hobby grade FDM
            printing but cannot guarantee perfect industrial tolerances.
          </p>
          <p>
            11.3 We may reprint at no additional cost if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A print fails clearly due to our machine or material issue.</li>
            <li>
              The final part is significantly different from the agreed design,
              such as a wrong scale or material due to our own mistake.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>11.4 Free reprints are not provided when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The original model file has errors or unsuitable dimensions for
              printing.
            </li>
            <li>
              The part fails during your use due to design related issues such
              as walls being too thin or joints being too weak.
            </li>
            <li>You change your mind after printing has started or completed.</li>
            <li>
              Functional or aesthetic expectations were not clearly communicated
              before printing.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            11.5 Orders may be cancelled before payment or before printing
            starts at no cost. Once printing has begun, cancellation may incur
            charges up to the full quoted amount.
